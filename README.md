# BrainMolecularAtlas

This is the code to reproduce the figures from the manuscript: A Standardized Brain Molecular Atlas: a resource for systems modeling and simulation (under review in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience)
The data processing toolkit (pipeline) code is available from the accompanying repository https://github.com/BlueBrain/MADIP 

## Getting Started

The Jupyter Notebooks and R scripts provide the details to reproduce the figures and are named according to the figures in the paper.

### Prerequisites

All libs that are imported in the code needs to be installed. This includes: 

Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Scipy, scikit\_posthoc 

R-script: RISmed, data.table, openxlsx, stringr, adjutant, dplyr, ggplot2, tidytext, Rtsne

### Installing

No need for specific installation procedure, only prerequisite dependencies need to be installed. Please use Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to run the ipynb code.

### Structure

Notebooks and scripts are named according to the figures in the paper
